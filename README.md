Nice to meet you! This repo includes the official documentation of [ct.js game engine](https://ctjs.rocks/). The documentation site runs on [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and is hosted on [docs.ctjs.rocks](https://docs.ctjs.rocks/).

In this repo, you can:

* [open an issue](https://github.com/CosmoMyzrailGorynych/docs.ctjs.rocks/issues/new) to highlight errors in docs, or send a pull request that will fix them;
* add a new tutorial;
* improve docs with better explanations and other stuff.

## Creating pull requests

Please organize your commits so each one changes, deletes or adds one subject: a tutorial, a function, a new module, a tip, etc. Examples:

* Adding one tutorial is a commit;
* Adding a tip or improving a paragraph is a commit;
* Changing an old variable to a new one across multiple documents is a commit.
